# Social-Media-App
This is our Social Media Project utilizing ArrayLists for Computer Science Applications

USE THE SOCIAL MEDIA CLASS FOR YOUR METHODS! This can all be adapted to the user class, but it doesn't really matter. 

We are going to have to add a post list to the user class and getters to access it from my Array List.

If we finish today, I might add text files so the posts and accounts can exist over multiple runs.
