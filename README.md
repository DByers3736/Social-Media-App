# Social-Media-App
This is our Social Media Project utilizing ArrayLists for Computer Science Applications

USE THE SOCIAL MEDIA CLASS FOR YOUR METHODS! This can all be adapted to the user class, but it doesn't really matter. 

Little Issue: the currentUser (curUser) in Social Media is always null. I've eliminated most problems and thenull exception error occurs somewhere there. 
It never changes from being null.
